    "- You must upload this notebook with your answers in the code block.\n",
    "- Each section has a score of 10, for a total score of 50.\n",
    "- Your code is expected to run smoothly, without warnings or errors, and should provide the desired answer. Any failure to comply with this instruction can lead to partial or null score.\n",

    "2. (0/2) Create a grid of complex numbers using `np.meshgrid` representing points in the complex plane.\n",
    "3. (0/2) Calculate the escape times for each complex $c$ of the previous grid using the function from step 2.\n",
