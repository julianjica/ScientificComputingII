    "Debugging is a crucial aspect of the software development process that involves identifying and resolving issues in code. These issues, commonly referred to as bugs, can cause unexpected behavior, errors, and incorrect outputs in software applications. Debugging is a fundamental skill that empowers developers to create reliable and functional software products.\n",
