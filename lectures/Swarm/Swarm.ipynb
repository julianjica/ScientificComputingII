    "## Swarm Intelligence: Formalizing Problem-Solving in Complex Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "Swarm intelligence (SI) is a subfield of artificial intelligence that draws inspiration from the collective behavior of decentralized, self-organized systems in nature. These systems, often composed of simple agents, exhibit complex global behaviors through local interactions. Examples include ant colonies, bird flocks, and fish schools.\n",

    "* **Self-Organization:** Global patterns emerge from local interactions, without explicit planning.\n",
